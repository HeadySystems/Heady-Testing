# IMPROVEMENTS

## What improved

### Local stack readiness
- The build now includes a real local orchestration file for the full 50-service stack.
- The stack now includes a collector service and a health-sweep script so runtime validation has a concrete path.

### Container correctness
- Generated Dockerfiles now install both required workspaces instead of only the shared platform package.
- Generated service containers now execute from the actual service workspace path.
- Health checks no longer rely on `localhost` references.

### Compliance hardening
- Runtime-critical localhost and `127.0.0.1` references were removed from shared platform defaults and Envoy bootstrap.
- A reusable compliance script now checks runtime-critical files and Dockerfiles for banned patterns.
- CI now runs regeneration, compliance validation, and tests automatically.

### Verification coverage
- The test suite now covers auth relay structure, platform auth layers, infrastructure artifacts, runtime compliance conditions, shared auth runtime hardening, and generated-site placeholder-link removal in addition to the earlier site and service index checks.

### Site and documentation coherence
- Generated sites now translate legacy registry anchors into working section destinations instead of shipping mismatched or dead navigation paths.
- Generated footers now replace placeholder entries like About and Careers with reachable internal or contact destinations.
- Shared browser auth runtime now enforces config-driven origin allowlists, relay nonces, and iframe sandboxing while surfacing listener failures as explicit browser events.
- Platform summary documentation now uses the updated flow/pause/probe language and PASS-tier example values.

## Recommended next improvement wave

1. Replace generic `/process` handlers with real service-specific logic for the highest-value services.
2. Add contract and smoke tests that boot selected services under Compose and assert healthy upstream chains.
3. Add stack-wide environment templates for secrets, auth relay domains, and service mesh certificates.
4. Expand browser-based auth propagation validation across the public sites using real issued session cookies.
5. Add deeper per-service docs and runbooks tied to the new local stack commands.
