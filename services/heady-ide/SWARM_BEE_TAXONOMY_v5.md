**Every bee reports**:
- `bee_id` (UUID)
- `bee_type` (one of 144)
- `swarm_id` (one of 21)
- `task_id` (parent task UUID)
- `status` (success | fail | preempt)
- `duration_ms` (execution time)
- `csl_score` (output quality 0.0–1.0)
- `tokens_consumed` (LLM tokens used)
- `cost_usd` (estimated cost)

## Swarm Coordination Patterns

### Stigmergic Communication
Bees communicate indirectly through shared Redis state:
```
tenant:{id}:pheromone:{swarm}:{signal_type} → {intensity, timestamp, source_bee}
```
Pheromone intensity decays at 1/φ per heartbeat cycle. Bees "smell" relevant pheromones and adjust behavior.

### φ-Ring Topology
All 21 swarms positioned on a ring at golden angle intervals (137.5°). This minimizes average communication hops:
```
Swarm position = (swarm_index × 137.508°) mod 360°
```
Adjacent swarms on the ring communicate directly; distant swarms route through intermediate swarms.

### Quorum Voting
Critical decisions require swarm quorum:
- **Simple quorum**: > 50% of active bees agree (routine tasks)
- **φ-quorum**: > 61.8% agree (reversible state changes)
- **Supermajority**: > 71.8% agree (irreversible actions: deploy, delete, trade)

### Swarm-to-Swarm Handoff Protocol
```
1. Source swarm emits HANDOFF pheromone with task vector
2. Target swarm's bees compute cos(task_vector, swarm_capability_vector)
3. If cosine ≥ CSL_INCLUDE (0.618) → accept handoff
4. If cosine < CSL_INCLUDE → reject, Overmind re-routes
5. Handoff logged with Trust Receipt (Ed25519 signature)
```
