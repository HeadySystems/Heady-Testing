# Heady Feature Specification Pack

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-03-17  
**Author:** Eric Haywood  
**Status:** Draft — Ready for Engineering and Product Review

---

## Overview

This specification pack covers ten high-value new features for the Heady ecosystem. Each spec is production-grade and includes purpose, user experience, architecture and data flows, security and privacy controls, feature dependencies, and a phased rollout plan. All specs are designed to compose with each other into a coherent "liquid latent OS" vision for Heady.

## Dependency Graph

The ten features compose into a layered architecture. Build order should follow dependency depth:

```
Layer 0 — Infrastructure Primitives
  ├── 001 Permission Graph and Delegation Vault
  └── 002 Memory Ledger

Layer 1 — Context and Isolation
  └── 003 Work-Area Orchestrator
      (depends on: 001, 002)

Layer 2 — Platform Delivery
  └── 004 Liquid Module Registry
      (depends on: 001, 003)

Layer 3 — Operational Control
  ├── 005 Mission Control Manager Surface
  │   (depends on: 001)
  ├── 006 Skill Foundry
  │   (depends on: 004)
  └── 007 Trust Receipts and Action Playback
      (depends on: 001, 005)

Layer 4 — Experience and Intelligence
  ├── 008 Cross-Device Handoff Mesh
  │   (depends on: 003, 005)
  ├── 009 Heady Arena
  │   (depends on: headyai.com router)
  └── 010 Projection Composer
      (depends on: 003, 004, 005)
```

## Recommended Build Sequence

For an 18-month program organized into quarters:

| Quarter | Features | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Q2 2026 | 001 Permission Graph, 002 Memory Ledger | Foundation; all other features depend on one or both |
| Q3 2026 | 003 Work-Area Orchestrator, 004 Liquid Module Registry, 005 Mission Control | Core platform and operational visibility layer |
| Q4 2026 | 006 Skill Foundry, 007 Trust Receipts, 009 Heady Arena | Developer ecosystem, trust infrastructure, model intelligence |
| Q1 2027 | 008 Cross-Device Handoff Mesh, 010 Projection Composer | Experience polish and the full "liquid OS" surface delivery |

## Spec Structure

Every spec in this pack follows a consistent format:

1. **Problem Statement** — User pain, affected audience, cost of inaction
2. **Goals** — Measurable outcomes with targets
3. **Non-Goals** — Explicit scope boundaries
4. **User Stories** — Prioritized, format: As a [user], I want [capability] so that [benefit]
5. **Requirements** — P0 (must-have) / P1 (should-have) / P2 (future), each with acceptance criteria
6. **User Experience** — Key UI flows with ASCII wireframes
7. **Architecture** — Component diagram, data models, storage choices, data flows
8. **Security and Privacy** — Threats mapped to mitigations
9. **Dependencies** — External and internal, with risk ratings
10. **Phased Rollout** — 3–4 phases with week estimates
11. **Success Metrics** — Leading and lagging indicators with targets
12. **Open Questions** — Blocking and non-blocking, tagged by owner

## Cross-Cutting Architecture Principles

These principles apply across all ten specs and should be enforced in implementation:

### Infrastructure

- **Edge-first:** All compute uses Cloudflare Workers; data uses D1, KV, R2, Durable Objects, Vectorize
- **User-scoped isolation:** Every data query includes `user_id` as a mandatory predicate
- **Append-only audit records:** Trust Receipts and audit logs use append-only writes; no UPDATE
- **Signed artifacts:** All receipts and handoff packages are HMAC-signed with user-specific keys

### Privacy

- **User owns the data:** All personal data (memories, receipts, preferences) is exportable and deletable on demand
- **GDPR Article 17 compliance:** Account deletion cascades to all personal data across all features
- **Consent before auto-extraction:** Memory and context data is never captured without explicit user consent (opt-in)
- **Purpose limitation:** Data collected for one feature is not silently repurposed for another

### Security

- **Least privilege:** All agent and skill grants use the minimum required scope
- **No self-modification:** Agents cannot modify their own permission grants
- **Server-side enforcement:** Permission checks, area isolation, and scope enforcement all run server-side in Workers; clients cannot override

### Developer Experience

- **Schema-first:** All modules, skills, and manifests are validated against schemas at submission time
- **Declarative configuration:** Context signals, permission requirements, and surface targets are declared in manifest files, not hardcoded in runtime logic
- **Standard pub/sub:** All inter-feature communication uses the MCP layer event stream; no direct coupling between features

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Work Area | A named, isolated context partition within a single user's Heady environment |
| Permission Grant | A scoped, time-limited authorization record allowing a specific agent/skill to take specific actions |
| Trust Receipt | A signed, tamper-evident record of a consequential agent action |
| Module | A registered, installable unit of Heady functionality (skill, connector, UI widget, automation) |
| Projection | A dynamically composed set of UI modules surfaced based on the current user context |
| Skill | A packaged unit of AI behavioral instructions loaded at inference time |
| Delegation Vault | The user-facing permission management surface showing all active grants |
| Memory Ledger | The user-facing view of all stored personal context fragments |
| Mission Control | The real-time operational dashboard for all in-flight agent tasks |
| Arena | The multi-model comparison surface for evaluating and routing model choices |
| Handoff | The transfer of an active session context from one device to another |
