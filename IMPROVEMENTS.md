# IMPROVEMENTS

*   **Secured Session Management:** Replaced `localStorage` storage of tokens with secure `httpOnly` `__heady_session` cookies via server-side updates in `src/routes/auth-routes.js`, and updated `public/auth.html` and `public/onboarding.html` to remove `localStorage.setItem` for auth tokens. Integrated `cookie-parser` into the backend.
*   **Hardened Task State:** Swapped `localStorage` to `sessionStorage` in `training/heady-task-manager.html` to limit data persistence footprint.
*   **Structured Logging:** Implemented a new `src/utils/logger.js` structured Pino JSON logger and retrofitted critical backend services (`heady-manager.js`, `quick-server.js`, `auth-routes.js`) to use `logger.info/error/warn` instead of `console.*` methods.
*   **Implemented Cryptographic Verification:** Replaced a TODO comment with actual HMAC-SHA256 signature verification logic in `oracle_service/src/oracle_server.py`.
*   **Enabled API Integration:** Implemented the `httpx`-based POST call with a $\phi$-scaled timeout in `oracle_service/src/oracle_server.py` and updated its `requirements.txt`.
*   **Completed Training Logic:** Filled in the missing Fibonacci growth and pattern generation logic in `training/hello-headystack.js`.
*   **Enabled CSP:** Added strict `helmet` Content Security Policy directives in `heady-manager.js`.
*   **Cleaned Merge Conflicts:** Systematically removed stray Git merge conflict markers across the codebase, carefully ensuring that the `HEAD` v4 architecture code was preserved.
