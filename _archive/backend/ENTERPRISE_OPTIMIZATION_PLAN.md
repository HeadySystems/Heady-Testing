# Heady™ Enterprise Optimization Plan

## 1) Stabilize the Control Plane

- Protect all admin/orchestrator endpoints with API-key authentication.
- Enforce request tracing (`x-request-id`) and capture route latency/error telemetry.
- Implement graceful shutdown for deploys and orchestration restarts.

## 2) Structure Dynamic Creation

- Standardize generated artifacts under `generated/<type>/<name>`.
- Require a `heady.manifest.json` for every generated asset.
- Index each asset in a persistent vector registry to support discovery and deduplication.

## 3) Enforce Operational SLOs

- Track p50/p95/p99 latency for control-plane APIs.
- Track in-flight requests, success rate, and server error rate.
- Set alert thresholds:
  - p95 > 300ms for 5 min (warn)
  - 5xx ratio > 1% for 5 min (critical)

## 4) Data Integrity & Self-Healing

- Use atomic writes for registry/vector persistence.
- On corruption, auto-backup the bad file and re-initialize to healthy defaults.
- Expose vector-store stats in orchestration status for governance visibility.

## 5) Continuous Hardening Roadmap

- Add OpenAPI spec + contract tests for admin/orchestrator endpoints.
- Add role-based auth on top of API key for enterprise multi-team operation.
- Add queue-backed build/audit execution with retries and dead-letter handling.
- Move vector persistence from JSON file to managed vector DB when scale demands.
