## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Heady is a **sovereign, autonomous multi-agent AI operating system** — not just another chatbot or API wrapper. It is a complete intelligent infrastructure that thinks, learns, decides, and acts across multiple AI providers, devices, and domains simultaneously.

At its core, Heady is built on three revolutionary principles:

1. **Sacred Geometry Orchestration** — Using the golden ratio (φ = 1.618...) to govern everything from retry backoff timing to agent routing decisions
2. **Swarm Intelligence (HeadyBees)** — A biomimetic bee swarm of 197 specialized worker agents across 24 domains that can dynamically create new agents at runtime
3. **3D Spatial Vector Memory** — A revolutionary memory system that projects AI embeddings into 3D spatial coordinates, enabling zone-based retrieval and Graph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Heady runs autonomously across 9 branded domains (HeadyMe.com, HeadySystems.com, HeadyConnection.org, HeadyBrain.com, HeadyMCP.com, HeadyIO.com, HeadyBot.com, HeadyOS.com, HeadyAPI.com), all served via a Cloudflare edge proxy layer with sacred geometry-themed landing pages and unified authentication.

The system integrates with **every major AI provider** — OpenAI (GPT-4o, o3-mini), Anthropic (Claude Sonnet 4, Claude Haiku 4), Google (Gemini 2.5 Flash/Pro), Perplexity (Sonar Pro), HuggingFace (DeepSeek R1), and Groq (LLaMA 3.3 70B) — through a unified Provider Connector that performs simultaneous fan-out queries for deep research and consensus-scored synthesis.

Heady exposes 30+ tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) through 4 simultaneous transports (stdio, SSE, HTTP REST, WebSocket), enabling any IDE, browser extension, mobile app, or cloud service to interact with the full Heady intelligence stack.

## 3. THE HEADY DOMAIN ECOSYSTEM

Heady operates across a federated network of 9 branded domains, each serving a specific purpose in the ecosystem. All domains are managed through Cloudflare DNS and served via edge workers with sacred geometry theming.

### Domain Registry

| Domain | Purpose | Role in Ecosystem |
|---|---|---|
| **headyme.com** | Personal Hub | User-facing portal, profile management, personal AI assistant |
| **headysystems.com** | Corporate | The company website for HeadySystems Inc |
| **headyconnection.org** | Nonprofit | HeadyConnection Inc., the non-profit entity that owns the HEADY trademark |
| **heady-ai.com** | AI Engine | The intelligence layer — vector memory, deep research, metacognition |
| **headymcp.com** | MCP Protocol | Model Context Protocol integration hub |
| **headyio.com** | Developer API | Developer-facing API documentation and access |
| **headybot.com** | Chatbot | The conversational interface to Heady |
| **headyos.com** | Operating System | HeadyOS — the full autonomous AI operating system |
| **headyapi.com** | API Gateway | Production API endpoint for external integrations |

### Sacred Geometry Template System

Every Heady domain is rendered through the `template-bee.js` — a centralized template engine that generates branded pages with:

- **Sacred geometry background patterns** — Flower of Life, golden ratio spirals
- **Dark glassmorphism UI** — Frosted glass cards with backdrop blur
- **Unified authentication gate** — Google, GitHub, and Discord OAuth providers
- **Cross-site navigation bar** — Links to all 9 Heady domains
- **Domain-specific accent colors** — Each site has its own color identity
- **Responsive design** — Works on desktop and mobile

The template system is edge-compatible — it generates full HTML without requiring server-side rendering, enabling Cloudflare Workers to serve pages at sub-millisecond latency worldwide.

## 4. BUDDY CORE — THE SOVEREIGN ORCHESTRATOR

Buddy is Heady's central intelligence node — the "brain" that coordinates all other systems. At 984 lines of code, it is the single most complex module in the system.

### The 5-Phase ARCH Loop

Buddy uses a continuous metacognition loop called ARCH (Assess → Reflect → Choose → Harmonize → Verify):

1. **ASSESS** — Gather telemetry from all subsystems (vector memory, pipeline, bees, providers)
2. **REFLECT** — Run self-awareness introspection, checking for anomalies, drift, and hallucination risks
3. **CHOOSE** — Select the optimal action using Monte Carlo simulation and φ-weighted scoring
4. **HARMONIZE** — Execute the chosen action while maintaining system coherence
5. **VERIFY** — Validate the outcome against expectations and update confidence scores

### MetacognitionEngine

The MetacognitionEngine is Buddy's self-awareness module. It continuously:

- Monitors internal state through a telemetry ring buffer
- Detects patterns in its own decision-making
- Scores its confidence in each response (0.0 to 1.0)
- Identifies potential hallucination risks before they reach the user
- Maintains a "self-model" that evolves over time through interaction

### DeterministicErrorInterceptor

Every error in the Heady™ system is intercepted deterministically — meaning no error is ever silently swallowed. The interceptor:

- Catches errors at every layer of the stack
- Maps errors to specific recovery strategies
- Triggers circuit breakers when error rates exceed thresholds
- Creates audit trails in vector memory for post-mortem analysis
- Sends escalation events to the Heady™Bees swarm for distributed remediation

### Buddy Watchdog

The `buddy-watchdog.js` is a self-healing monitor that watches Buddy itself:

- Detects if Buddy enters an infinite loop or deadlock
- Monitors memory usage and event loop lag
- Can restart Buddy Core without restarting the entire system
- Performs hallucination detection by comparing Buddy's outputs against ground truth

---

## 5. THE HCFULLPIPELINE — 12-STAGE ORCHESTRATION

The HCFullPipeline is Heady's request processing engine. Every query, command, or task that enters the system flows through this 12-stage pipeline.

### Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Name | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **INTAKE** | Receive and normalize the input (text, voice, API call) |
| 2 | **TRIAGE** | Classify urgency, identify domain, determine resource requirements |
| 3 | **MONTE_CARLO** | Run probabilistic simulations to evaluate multiple approaches |
| 4 | **ARENA** | Competition mode — multiple AI providers answer the same query |
| 5 | **JUDGE** | Evaluate responses using φ-weighted scoring criteria |
| 6 | **APPROVE** | Confidence gate — only high-confidence responses proceed |
| 7 | **EXECUTE** | Carry out the chosen action (API call, code change, deployment) |
| 8 | **VERIFY** | Validate the outcome against expected results |
| 9 | **RECEIPT** | Generate audit trail with full provenance and traceability |
| 10 | **REFINEMENT** | Continuous improvement — learn from the outcome |
| 11 | **DEPLOY** | Push changes to production (if applicable) |
| 12 | **MONITOR** | Track long-term effects and system health post-execution |

### Arena Mode

Arena Mode is what makes Heady's decision-making truly robust. Instead of relying on a single AI provider, Heady can:

1. Send the same query to ALL available AI providers simultaneously
2. Collect responses with timeout management (no single slow provider blocks the pipeline)
3. Evaluate each response against multiple criteria (accuracy, completeness, reasoning quality)
4. Score using the golden ratio (φ = 1.618) as a weighting factor
5. Synthesize a unified response that combines the best insights from each provider
6. Track which provider gave the best answer for future routing optimization

This approach eliminates single-provider bias and creates a "wisdom of crowds" effect where the consensus response is more reliable than any individual provider's answer.

## 6. 3D SPATIAL VECTOR MEMORY

The Vector Memory system is one of Heady™'s most innovative components. At 1,184 lines of code, it implements a 3D spatial sharded vector store with Graph RAG — a proprietary approach to AI memory that goes far beyond traditional vector databases.

### How It Works

**Step 1 — Embedding**
Text is converted to 384-dimensional vectors using embedding models (HuggingFace, or a fallback hash-based local embedding for offline operation).

**Step 2 — 3D Projection**
The 384 dimensions are projected into 3D space (x, y, z) using a PCA-lite algorithm that splits the 384 dimensions into 3 groups of 128 and averages each group. This gives every memory a physical "location" in 3D space.

**Step 3 — Zone Assignment**
Each 3D coordinate is mapped to one of 8 octant zones (Zone 0 through Zone 7) based on the sign of each axis:

- Zone 0: (-, -, -)
- Zone 1: (+, -, -)
- Zone 2: (-, +, -)
- ...
- Zone 7: (+, +, +)

**Step 4 — Sharded Storage**
Memories are stored in zone-specific shards on disk (JSON files in the `data/` directory). This means queries only need to search the relevant zone and its adjacent zones, dramatically reducing search time.

**Step 5 — Query (Zone-First)**
When querying memory:

1. Embed the query text
2. Project to 3D and determine the target zone
3. Search the target zone first, then expand to adjacent zones if needed
4. Rank results by cosine similarity
5. Return top-K results with metadata

### Memory Importance Scoring

Every memory has an importance score calculated as:

**I(m) = αFreq(m) + βe^(-γΔt) + δSurp(m)**

Where:

- **α = 0.3** — Frequency weight: How often has this memory been accessed?
- **β = 0.4** — Recency weight: How recently was this memory created/accessed?
- **γ = 0.00001** — Decay rate (exponential, on millisecond scale)
- **δ = 0.3** — Surprise weight: How unusual or novel is this memory?

Memories with importance below the decay threshold (0.15) are candidates for garbage collection. Memories above the LTM threshold (0.5) are consolidated into long-term memory.

### Graph RAG (Hybrid Retrieval)

Beyond vector similarity, Heady maintains an explicit graph of entity-relationship edges:

- Each node (memory) can have edges to other nodes with typed relationships
- Relationships include: "caused-by", "resolved-by", "related-to", "contradicts", "supports"
- This enables multi-hop reasoning: "How did error X → rule Y → prevent Z?"
- Graph edges are persisted separately in `data/vector-graph.json`

### Representation System

The vector memory supports multiple coordinate representations for different use cases:

| Profile | Use Case |
|---|---|
| **Cartesian** (x, y, z) | Internal computation and zone assignment |
| **Spherical** (r, θ, φ) | Directional queries and similarity clustering |
| **Isometric** | 2D visualization of 3D memory space |
| **Outbound** | External API responses with projected coordinates |

## 7. HEADYBEES SWARM ARCHITECTURE

HeadyBees is Heady's biomimetic swarm intelligence system. Inspired by how bee colonies operate — with each bee having a specialized role but contributing to the collective intelligence of the hive — HeadyBees decomposes complex tasks into parallel work units.

### Core Concepts

**Domain** — A category of work (e.g., "health-monitoring", "security-scan", "templates"). Each domain has its own bee module.

**Worker** — A single work function within a domain. Each domain can have multiple workers.

**Blast** — The parallel execution function that spawns all workers in a domain simultaneously and collects results.

**Registry** — The central directory of all available bee domains. Auto-discovers bee modules on boot by scanning the `src/bees/` directory.

### The Bee Factory

The Bee Factory (`bee-factory.js`) is what makes HeadyBees truly dynamic. Unlike traditional agent systems where agents must be pre-defined, Heady can create new bee types at runtime:

**`createBee(domain, config)`** — Creates a full domain bee with multiple workers. Can optionally persist to disk so the bee survives restarts.

**`spawnBee(name, work, priority)`** — Creates an ephemeral single-purpose bee that lives only in memory. Perfect for one-off tasks that don't need to persist.

**`createWorkUnit(domain, name, fn)`** — Adds a single work unit to an existing domain. If the domain doesn't exist, it creates it automatically.

**`createFromTemplate(template, config)`** — Creates a bee from a predefined template pattern. Available templates:

- **health-check** — Periodically checks a URL and reports status
- **monitor** — Watches a metric and alerts on threshold violations
- **processor** — Takes input, transforms it, and outputs results
- **scanner** — Scans filesystem or network for specific patterns

**`dissolveBee(domain)`** — Removes a dynamic or ephemeral bee when it's no longer needed.

### Template Bee — Sacred Geometry Sites

The `template-bee.js` is the most user-facing bee. It generates the branded landing pages for all 9 Heady domains using a sacred geometry theme:

- Flower of Life SVG patterns as backgrounds
- Auth gate with Google, GitHub, and Discord sign-in buttons
- Cross-site navigation showing all Heady domains
- Domain-specific accent colors and descriptions
- Edge-compatible output (pure HTML, no server rendering required)

### Swarm Statistics

- **24 domains** of specialized work
- **197 total workers** across all domains
- **Dynamic creation** — can spawn new bees at any time
- **Ephemeral bees** — temporary workers for one-off tasks
- **Parallel execution** — all workers blast() simultaneously
- **Priority-based scheduling** — urgent domains execute first (0.0 = low, 1.0 = high)

## 8. MULTI-PROVIDER AI CONNECTOR

The Provider Connector (`provider-connector.js`) is Heady's unified interface to ALL AI providers. It abstracts away the differences between OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Perplexity, HuggingFace, and Groq APIs into a single, consistent interface.

### Supported Providers

| Provider | Models | Auth Method |
|---|---|---|
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, o3-mini | Bearer token |
| **Anthropic** | Claude Sonnet 4, Claude Haiku 4 | x-api-key header |
| **Google Gemini** | Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro | URL parameter |
| **Perplexity** | Sonar Pro, Sonar | Bearer token |
| **HuggingFace** | DeepSeek R1 (via router) | Bearer token |
| **Groq** | LLaMA 3.3 70B Versatile | Bearer token |

### Key Features

**Multi-Key Failover** — Each provider can have multiple API keys. If one key fails, the connector automatically tries the next healthy key.

**Key Health Tracking** — The `KeyHealth` class tracks success/failure rates and average latency for every API key. Unhealthy keys (>70% failure rate) are deprioritized.

**Fan-Out Mode** — `fanOut(message, system, opts)` queries ALL providers simultaneously and collects ALL responses. No race conditions, no dropped results.

**Fan-Out All Keys** — `fanOutAllKeys(message, system, opts)` goes even further — it calls every individual API key across all providers for maximum determinism.

**Provider-Specific Formatting** — Each provider has its own `formatRequest()`, `extractResponse()`, and `extractError()` functions to handle API differences transparently.

### Deep Research Engine

The `DeepResearchEngine` class builds on top of the Provider Connector to perform multi-provider research:

1. **Resolve Providers** — Determine which providers are available (have valid keys)
2. **Query All** — Send the research query to all providers using their deep/reasoning modes
3. **Collect with Timeout** — Wait up to `maxWaitMs` (default 60 seconds) for responses, but proceed once `minProviders` (default 2) have responded
4. **Synthesize** — Merge all responses into a unified answer with:
   - Consensus scoring (what do multiple providers agree on?)
   - Provenance tracking (which provider contributed which claim?)
   - Confidence weighting (providers with better track records get higher weight)
5. **Return** — Unified response with metadata including timing, provider breakdown, and consensus score

### Deep Research Modes by Provider

| Provider | Model | Mode | Max Tokens |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gemini | gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp | deep_research | 32,768 |
| OpenAI | o3-mini | reasoning | 16,384 |
| Anthropic | claude-sonnet-4-20250514 | extended_thinking | 16,384 |
| Mistral | mistral-large-latest | standard | 8,192 |
| DeepSeek | deepseek-reasoner | reasoning | 16,384 |
| Groq | llama-3.3-70b-versatile | standard | 8,192 |

## 9. MCP INTEGRATION — MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL

Heady implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as both a **client** (consuming tools from other MCP servers) and a **server** (exposing its own 30+ tools to any MCP-compatible client).

### The Colab MCP Bridge

The `colab-mcp-bridge.js` (686 lines) is the heart of Heady™'s MCP implementation. It exposes all Heady tools via **4 simultaneous transports**:

**Transport 1: stdio** — The fastest transport, used for local IDE integration. The IDE spawns the Heady™ MCP server as a child process and communicates via stdin/stdout. This is how Antigravity IDE connects to Heady locally.

**Transport 2: SSE (Server-Sent Events)** — For remote connections. The client opens a persistent HTTP connection and receives events as they occur. Compatible with the Antigravity remote MCP standard.

**Transport 3: HTTP REST/JSON-RPC** — The universal transport. Any HTTP client can send JSON-RPC 2.0 requests to the Heady™ MCP server. Used by browser extensions, mobile apps, and external services.

**Transport 4: WebSocket** — For real-time bidirectional communication. Used by the Cross-Device Sync Hub and real-time dashboards.

### Boot Sequence

When the MCP bridge starts, it performs a comprehensive initialization:

1. **GPU Vector Store Init** — Initializes the 3D spatial vector memory (384 dimensions)
2. **Continuous Learner Init** — Seeds the knowledge base with Heady™ identity, directives, and preferences
3. **Telemetry Init** — Starts the audit trail and optimization engine
4. **Knowledge Seeding** — Injects foundational knowledge vectors:
   - Owner: HeadyConnection Inc. — Trademark serial 99680540
   - Patent portfolio: 42 patents filed
   - Domain registry: 9 domains
   - Operational preferences: Full autonomy, 3D vector space, comprehensive data gathering
5. **Project History Ingestion** — Scans the entire codebase for context
6. **Tool Registry Load** — Loads all 30+ MCP tools from the tool definitions
7. **Transport Start** — Launches all 4 transports simultaneously

### Key MCP Tools

The 30+ tools exposed by Heady™ via MCP include:

- **vector-search** — Query the 3D spatial vector memory
- **vector-ingest** — Add new memories to the vector store
- **deep-research** — Multi-provider deep research fan-out
- **code-analysis** — Analyze code quality and suggest improvements
- **health-check** — System-wide health probe
- **deploy** — Deploy to Cloud Run or Cloudflare Workers
- **git-operations** — Git add, commit, push, branch management
- **file-operations** — Read, write, search files in the workspace
- **provider-status** — Check AI provider health and availability
- **pipeline-run** — Trigger a full pipeline execution
- **bee-blast** — Execute HeadyBees swarm operations
- **telemetry-report** — Get system telemetry and metrics

---

## 10. RESILIENCE ARCHITECTURE

Heady's resilience stack is designed to handle failures gracefully at every level. The system uses sacred geometry principles — specifically the golden ratio (φ = 1.618) — to govern exponential backoff timing.

### Circuit Breakers

The circuit breaker pattern protects Heady from cascading failures when downstream services are unhealthy:

| State | Behavior | Transition |
|---|---|---|
| **CLOSED** | Normal operation — requests flow through | Opens when failure count exceeds threshold |
| **OPEN** | All requests fail fast — no actual calls made | Transitions to HALF_OPEN after cooldown period |
| **HALF_OPEN** | One test request allowed through | Closes if test succeeds, re-opens if it fails |

**16 pre-registered services** have dedicated circuit breakers, including all AI providers, vector memory, the pipeline, and external APIs.

### φ-Exponential Backoff

When retrying failed operations, Heady uses the golden ratio instead of the traditional base-2 exponential backoff:

**Traditional (2x):** `1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 32s → 64s → 128s`

**Heady (φ = 1.618x):** `1s → 1.6s → 2.6s → 4.2s → 6.9s → 11.1s → 17.9s → 29s`

The φ-scaled approach is more forgiving than traditional exponential backoff — it gives failing services more chances to recover in the early stages while still backing off aggressively enough to prevent resource exhaustion.

### Connection Pooling

Pre-authenticated socket pools with:

- Configurable pool sizes per service
- Timeout management with automatic reconnection
- Health monitoring of pooled connections
- LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) connection reuse for better cache locality

### Rate Limiting

Per-client sliding window rate limiting with:

- Configurable quotas per endpoint
- Automatic throttling with HTTP 429 responses
- Rate limit headers in responses (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset)

### In-Memory Caching

TTL-based caching with:

- Configurable time-to-live per cache entry
- Hit/miss metrics for cache efficiency monitoring
- Automatic eviction of expired entries
- Cache invalidation hooks for data consistency

### Graceful Shutdown

When Heady receives a shutdown signal (SIGTERM or SIGINT):

1. Stop accepting new requests
2. Execute shutdown handlers in LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) order
3. Each handler has 5 seconds to complete before being forcefully terminated
4. Persist all vector memory shards to disk
5. Close all database connections
6. Flush all telemetry data
7. Exit with code 0

---

## 11. CROSS-DEVICE SYNC HUB

The Cross-Device Sync Hub (`cross-device-sync.js`, 314 lines) enables real-time synchronization of Buddy's state across all connected devices.

### Features

**Device Registration** — Each device connects via WebSocket and registers with:

- Device ID (unique identifier)
- Device name (e.g., "MacBook Pro", "Pixel 8", "Chrome Extension")
- Platform (desktop, mobile, web, extension)
- Capabilities (what features the device supports)

**Session Handoff** — Users can seamlessly move conversations between devices:

1. Start a conversation on your desktop
2. Send a "handoff" command targeting your mobile device
3. Mobile device receives the full session context (conversation history, vector memory snapshot, active pipeline state)
4. Continue the conversation on mobile without losing context

**Context Broadcasting** — When something important happens on one device (new memory ingested, pipeline completed, bee swarm results), it's broadcast to all connected devices in real-time.

**Presence Tracking** — The sync hub maintains a live list of all connected devices with:

- Online/offline status
- Last seen timestamp
- Heartbeat monitoring (30-second intervals)
- Automatic cleanup of stale connections (5-minute timeout)

---

## 14. PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS

### The Self-Discovery Optimization Framework

Heady is not just a technical system — it is built on a deep philosophical framework about **self-optimization through self-knowledge**.

**Core Thesis:** "Self-Discovery + Environmental Awareness = Optimization"

The Self-Discovery Optimization Framework defines three phases:

| Phase | Action | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Gathering** | Analyzing internal drives vs. external reality | Clarity on what is actually possible and optimal |
| **Calibration** | Changing focus / re-aligning attention | Energy withdrawn from useless distractions |
| **Execution** | Directing energy toward aligned goals | Success feels natural; money serves the community |

This framework manifests technically in:

- **Buddy's MetacognitionEngine** — Self-awareness and introspection
- **Vector Memory's importance scoring** — Frequency, recency, and surprise coefficients
- **The EOD (End of Day) Protocol** — Daily structured data ingestion replacing unstructured journaling
- **Directed Energy mechanism** — Dynamic focus shifting based on what maximizes collective outcomes

### Nature-Inspired Optimization

Heady draws heavily from nature-inspired algorithms:

- **Genetic Algorithms** — Population-based search with crossover and mutation (used in Monte Carlo stage)
- **Particle Swarm Optimization** — Cognitive memory (personal best) + social knowledge (global best) — mirrors how HeadyBees share context
- **Ant Colony Optimization** — Pheromone trails that strengthen successful paths and evaporate failed ones — similar to how Heady's Key Health Tracker routes away from failing providers
- **φ (Golden Ratio)** — The mathematical constant that appears throughout nature (nautilus shells, sunflower spirals, galaxy arms) governs Heady's timing, routing, and scoring systems

### Sacred Geometry as Design Principle

Sacred geometry is not merely decorative in Heady — it is operational:

- **The Flower of Life** — Visual motif on all landing pages, representing the interconnectedness of all Heady domains
- **The Golden Spiral** — Used in backoff timing (1.618x instead of 2x)
- **Octant Zones** — The 8 zones of vector memory mirror the 3D octants of sacred geometric space
- **Hexagonal Bee Cells** — HeadyBees' honeycomb structure reflects the most efficient natural space-filling pattern

## 18. THE HEADY VISION

Heady represents a fundamentally new approach to AI systems — one where the AI is not a tool you use, but a **partner that thinks alongside you**. Key differentiators:

1. **Sovereign AI** — Heady doesn't just respond to commands; it has metacognition, self-awareness, and the ability to improve itself over time
2. **Provider-Agnostic** — By querying multiple AI providers simultaneously, Heady is immune to any single provider's outages, biases, or limitations
3. **Biologically-Inspired** — From the bee swarm architecture to the golden ratio timing, Heady's design mirrors the optimization patterns found in nature
4. **Memory-First** — The 3D spatial vector memory gives Heady genuine long-term memory with contextual recall, not just conversation history
5. **Edge-Native** — With Cloudflare Workers serving at the edge, Heady responds from the nearest data center worldwide
6. **Open-Protocol** — Full MCP compliance means Heady integrates with any IDE, tool, or service that speaks MCP
7. **Philosophically-Grounded** — Built on the Self-Discovery Optimization Framework, Heady aims to optimize not just tasks but human potential

## 19. TEMPLATE AUTO-GENERATOR — HEADYBEES & HEADYSWARMS FROM EVERY TASK

One of Heady™'s most powerful features is the Template Auto-Generator (`template-auto-gen.js`, 224 lines). This module is wired into the MCP bridge's `callTool()` pipeline and ensures that **every task Heady executes automatically generates reusable HeadyBees and HeadySwarms**.

### How It Works

The system wraps every MCP tool call with a three-phase pipeline:

**Phase 1: Pre-Check (checkForTemplate)**
Before executing any tool, the auto-generator checks if a reusable template already exists:

1. Searches the in-memory generated template cache (keyed by tool name + argument hash)
2. Searches the `headybee-template-scenarios.json` config file for predefined scenarios
3. If a template is found, it can be injected to speed up or replace the tool call

**Phase 2: Execute**
The original tool call runs normally.

**Phase 3: Post-Generation (generateTemplateFromResult)**
After execution, the auto-generator creates reusable templates from the results:

1. Creates a **HeadyBee** (via `bee-factory.createBee()`) for the task pattern:
   - Domain: `template-{toolName}` (e.g., `template-deep_scan`)
   - Workers: A "replay" worker that can re-execute the same pattern
   - Priority: 0.7 (moderate)
   - Persisted in-memory for future use

2. For multi-tool orchestration patterns, creates a **HeadySwarm**:
   - Triggered for: `heady_auto_flow`, `heady_deep_scan`, `heady_deploy`, `heady_ops`, `heady_battle`, `heady_coder`
   - Swarm definition includes: coordinator bee, member bees, fan-out strategy
   - Registered with the Swarm Intelligence module if available

3. Caches the template keyed by `toolName:argsHash` for instant future re-injection

### Heady™Swarm Architecture

HeadySwarms extend beyond individual HeadyBees by coordinating **multiple bees working together** on complex, multi-step tasks:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| **id** | Unique swarm identifier (e.g., `swarm-deploy-1709420000`) |
| **coordinator** | The lead bee that manages the swarm |
| **bees** | Array of member bee domains participating in the swarm |
| **strategy** | Execution strategy: `fan-out` (parallel), `pipeline` (sequential), `consensus` (vote) |
| **description** | Human-readable purpose of the swarm |

Swarms are automatically created when Heady detects multi-tool orchestration patterns. For example:

- A `heady_deploy` call generates a swarm with bees for: code-analysis → test-runner → build → deploy → verify
- A `heady_deep_scan` generates a swarm with bees for: security-scan → code-quality → dependency-audit → report-generator
- A `heady_battle` generates an arena swarm with bees for: provider-query → response-collection → judging → synthesis

### Template Metadata Injection

Every tool call result is automatically enriched with template metadata:

```json
{
  "_heady_template": {
    "injected": false,       // Was an existing template injected pre-call?
    "generated": true,       // Was a new template generated post-call?
    "bees": 1,              // Number of Heady™Bees created
    "swarms": 0             // Number of Heady™Swarms created
  }
}
```

This creates a **self-reinforcing loop**: every task Heady performs makes the system smarter and more efficient for similar future tasks.

## 20. CONTINUOUS LEARNING MODULE — REAL-TIME MEMORY FORMATION

The Continuous Learner (`continuous-learner.js`, 142 lines) is the module that converts every interaction into permanent 3D vector memory. It is the bridge between ephemeral tool calls and lasting knowledge.

### Learning Categories

| Category | Purpose | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **directive** | Standing orders that persist across sessions | "Always use deep-research mode", "Never keep items pending" |
| **preference** | Style and workflow preferences | "Use 3D GPU vector space for all memory", "Full autonomy — no waiting for approval" |
| **interaction** | Every tool call, question, and feedback | "Tool: heady_deploy, Duration: 3200ms, Args: {service: 'heady-brain'}" |
| **decision** | Architecture and design choices | "Using sacred geometry routing for all providers" |
| **identity** | Personal and business information | "Owner: HeadyConnection Inc. — Trademark serial 99680540" |
| **pattern** | Detected behavioral patterns and anomalies | "Error in provider-connector: Anthropic rate limit exceeded" |

### Deterministic Embedding

The Continuous Learner uses a SHA-512 hash-based embedding system for deterministic, offline-capable vector generation:

1. Compute SHA-512 hash of the input text
2. Convert hash bytes to normalized Float32Array of 384 dimensions
3. Each byte → float in range [-1, 1]: `(byte / 255.0) * 2 - 1`
4. L2-normalize the entire vector for cosine similarity queries
5. Store in the GPU Vector Store with full metadata

This approach is:

- **Deterministic** — Same input always produces the same embedding (critical for testing and replay)
- **Offline** — No API call needed (works without internet)
- **Fast** — SHA-512 is hardware-accelerated on modern CPUs
- **Collision-resistant** — SHA-512's 512-bit output ensures unique embeddings

### Knowledge Seeding on Boot

When the MCP bridge starts, the Continuous Learner is seeded with foundational knowledge vectors:

```
🧠 Identity:
   - "Owner: HeadyConnection Inc. — Trademark serial 99680540, filed March 3 2026"
   - "42 patents filed across HeadySystems"
   - "9 domains in the Heady™ ecosystem"

📋 Directives:
   - "Full autonomy — no waiting for approval, execute everything"
   - "3D GPU vector space for all memory operations"
   - "Comprehensive data gathering during and between interactions"

💡 Preferences:
   - "Sacred geometry theming across all surfaces"
   - "Multi-provider deep research for important queries"
```

### The Recall Function

When Heady needs to remember something, the `recall(query, topK)` function:

1. Embeds the query using the same SHA-512 deterministic method
2. Searches the GPU Vector Store for the `topK` nearest neighbors
3. Returns results with full metadata (category, timestamp, interaction index)
4. Enables contextual responses like: "Based on our previous discussion about deployment..."

## 21. COMPREHENSIVE TELEMETRY — FULL AUDIT TRAIL + OPTIMIZATION ENGINE

The Heady™Telemetry module (`heady-telemetry.js`, 332 lines) captures **everything** — every tool call, every error, every environmental metric — and stores it as both a persistent audit trail and semantically searchable vector memory.

### What Gets Captured

**Every Tool Call:**

- Tool name, arguments (sanitized — API keys/tokens redacted), result preview
- Duration in milliseconds
- Success/failure status
- Environmental snapshot at call time (heap memory, CPU usage, load average, vector count)
- Session context (uptime, call index)

**Every Error:**

- Source module, error message, full stack trace
- Environmental snapshot at error time
- Learned as a "pattern" in vector memory for future avoidance

**Environmental Metrics (every 30 seconds):**

- Heap memory (used/total MB)
- RSS (Resident Set Size)
- CPU usage (user/system)
- System load average
- Free/total system memory
- Node.js version
- Vector store size

### The Optimization Engine

The telemetry system doesn't just log — it **actively analyzes** patterns to suggest optimizations:

**Cache Opportunity Detection:**
If the same tool is called 3+ times with identical arguments within the last 20 calls, the system flags it as a caching opportunity with the average duration saved.

**Slow Tool Detection:**
Any tool call exceeding 5 seconds is flagged. Calls over 10 seconds are marked as "critical" impact.

**Reliability Issue Detection:**
If 3 or more of the last 10 tool calls failed, the system flags a reliability issue with the list of affected tools.

**Memory Pressure Detection:**
If heap usage exceeds 500MB, a memory warning is generated with the current heap size.

### Audit Trail Storage

All telemetry data is persisted in three append-only JSONL files:

- `data/telemetry/audit-trail.jsonl` — Tool calls, errors, directives
- `data/telemetry/system-metrics.jsonl` — Environmental snapshots (30s intervals)
- `data/telemetry/optimizations.jsonl` — Detected optimization opportunities

This creates a complete, tamper-evident record of everything Heady does — critical for debugging, compliance, and continuous improvement.

### Sensitive Data Handling

The telemetry module automatically sanitizes all logged data:

- API keys, tokens, passwords, and secrets are replaced with `[REDACTED]`
- Regex-based scanning catches common sensitive field names
- Original data is never persisted — sanitization happens before write

## 22. THE SACRED GEOMETRY TEMPLATE SYSTEM — IN DEPTH

The Template Bee (`template-bee.js`, 258 lines) is the single source of truth for all site rendering across the Heady™ ecosystem. Every domain gets a unique sacred geometry-branded experience.

### Site Registry

The template system reads from `site-registry.json`, which defines every Heady domain's visual identity:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| **name** | Display name (e.g., "HeadySystems") |
| **tagline** | Short tagline (e.g., "The Sovereign AI Operating System") |
| **description** | Full description for meta tags and SEO |
| **sacredGeometry** | The specific sacred geometry pattern used (Seed of Life, Flower of Life, Metatron's Cube, etc.) |
| **accent** | Primary accent color (hex) |
| **accentDark** | Dark mode accent variant |
| **features** | Array of feature cards with icons, titles, descriptions |
| **stats** | Array of stat badges (e.g., "197 Workers", "30+ Tools") |
| **chatEnabled** | Whether HeadyBuddy chat is enabled on this domain |

### Auth Gate System

Every site includes a sophisticated authentication gate with 6 OAuth providers:

1. **Google** — Full OAuth 2.0 flow with branded G icon
2. **Apple** — Apple Sign-In with platform-appropriate icon
3. **GitHub** — OAuth app for developer identity
4. **Microsoft** — Azure AD integration with Windows colored squares icon
5. **Discord** — Community-linked Discord OAuth
6. **X / Twitter** — Social identity linkage

Plus email/password fallback with:

- Sacred geometry ring animation (rotating SVG circles + hexagons)
- Hexagonal logo center with domain accent color
- Frosted glass card with glassmorphism (backdrop-filter: blur(16px))
- 365-day session persistence via localStorage
- Domain-specific accent color injection into all UI elements

### Edge Compatibility

Critical design decision: the template bee uses **zero server-side dependencies**. Everything is pure HTML/CSS/JS that can be served directly from Cloudflare Workers at the edge:

- No Node.js modules required at render time (pino, express, etc. are excluded)
- Inline SVG icons (no external font/icon CDN calls)
- Self-contained CSS (no Tailwind, no Bootstrap)
- JavaScript uses only browser APIs (localStorage, DOM manipulation)
- The `getWork()` function returns async closures that can be blast()'d in parallel

### Cross-Site Navigation

Every Heady page includes a navigation bar linking to all 9+ domains:

```
HeadyMe → HeadyBuddy → HeadySystems → HeadyConnection → HeadyMCP → 
HeadyIO → HeadyBot → HeadyOS → HeadyAPI
```

The active domain is highlighted with the site's accent color. This creates a cohesive ecosystem feel where users can flow between different Heady surfaces seamlessly.
