# Comprehensive Systems Architecture and Hardening Update

## Heady™Me Pre-Production Environment

> **Status**: Hardening Roadmap  
> **Date**: 2026-03  
> **Classification**: Engineering / DevOps / Security

---

## Architectural Foundations

The Heady™Me repository is defined by its pursuit of decentralized, multi-agent orchestration mechanisms via the **Sacred Geometry** paradigm — a deterministic, spatially mapped routing protocol between independent software agents. This is coupled with the **HCFullPipeline** (bespoke CI/CD) and **MCP integration** for standardized AI agent context management.

**Current state**: Profound entropy and technical debt — 90+ root-level files, monolithic God classes, conflicting deployment scripts, and critical security vulnerabilities.

---

## Phase 1: Immediate Security Remediation

### Exposed Database Credentials

- `.env.hybrid` tracked in public Git history exposes `postgresql://heady:heady_secret@...`
- Must use `git filter-repo` or BFG Repo Cleaner to strip from **all** historical commits
- Rotate `heady_secret` immediately on database server
- Inject new credentials via secure secret manager (AWS Secrets Manager / HashiCorp Vault / GitHub Actions Secrets)

### Operational Telemetry Leakage

Files tracked that must be purged from history:

| File | Risk |
|---|---|
| `server.pid` | Exposes host OS process allocation strategy |
| `audit_logs.jsonl` | Reveals internal state machine, routing paths, exception traces |
| `.heady_deploy_log.jsonl` | Full deployment footprint exposure |

### Codebase Redundancy

- `heady-manager.js.bak` (71KB) — full app logic backup committed to VCS — **delete entirely**

### Automated Secret Governance

- Expand `.gitignore`: `*.env*`, `*.pid`, `*.bak`, `audit_logs*`, `*.log`
- Enable **GitHub Advanced Security** + **secret scanning alerts** (entropy analysis + pattern matching)

---

## Phase 2: Resolving Codebase Entropy

### God Class Eradication

| File | Size | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `heady-manager.js` | 90KB | Decompose into `/src/routes/`, `/src/middleware/`, `/src/services/` |
| `site-generator.js` | 91KB | Decompose into dedicated module directory |

### Deployment Script Consolidation

Current scripts (all conflicting):

- `hcautobuild.ps1`
- `hc_autobuild.ps1`
- `hcautobuild_enhanced.ps1`
- `hcautobuild_optimizer.ps1`

→ Consolidate into **single parameterized build script** with env flags

### Polyglot Boundary Demarcation

- Isolate Python → `/src/python/` with proper `__init__.py`
- Isolate Node.js → `/src/node/`
- Merge `config/` + `configs/` → single `/config/`
- Choose single package manager (npm OR pnpm), remove conflicting lockfile

---

## Phase 3: DevOps Hardening & CI Pipeline

### SAST Integration

- Integrate **GitHub CodeQL** or **Semgrep** into GitHub Actions
- Fail builds on high-severity code-level vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, prototype pollution)

### Dependency Auditing

- Add automated `npm audit` to CI workflow
- Implement dependency review action for all PRs
- Block merges introducing dependencies with known CVEs

### Repository Governance

- Enforce **branch protection rules** on `main`:
  - Mandatory PR reviews by code owners
  - All status checks (Jest, CodeQL, npm audit) must pass before merge
- Migrate Dockerfiles to **multi-stage builds** (Alpine/Distroless final images)
- Run containers as **non-root user**
- Add **post-deployment smoke tests** to `deploy-render.yml`

---

## Phase 4: Documentation & Version Control

### Versioning Crisis

| Source | Claims Version |
|---|---|
| `package.json` | 2.1.0 |
| `.env.hybrid` | 2.0.0 |
| `.env.example` | 3.0.0 |
| System docs | 3.0.0+ |

→ Implement `heady-registry.json` as **single canonical version source**  
→ All CI, containers, and agent envs must query this registry dynamically

### Documentation Consolidation

- 7+ root-level README files → single `README.md` with auto-generated TOC
- All granular docs → `/docs/` directory
- Root README = executive summary + links to `/docs/`

---

## Phase 5: Performance & Scalability

### Redis Connection Pooling

- Implement persistent, pre-authenticated connection pool
- Calculate pool size from expected concurrency limits
- Target sub-millisecond data retrieval during traffic spikes

### Structured Logging

- Replace all `console.log` → **Pino** (NDJSON output)
- Include: ISO-8601 timestamps, severity levels, correlation IDs, execution contexts

### Health Endpoints & Bundle Optimization

- Expose `/health`, `/ready`, `/live` for orchestrator health checks
- Audit all 14 production dependencies — prune unused via AST analysis

---

## Phase 6: PERFECT SETUP — Automated Agent Implementation

### Step 1: Cryptographic Sealing

1. Execute `git filter-repo` to obliterate `.env.hybrid` + operational logs
2. Establish `heady-registry.json` as versioning truth
3. Enable GitHub secret scanning before proceeding

### Step 2: Render.com Dual-Runtime

- **Node.js Ingress**: Web Service → `0.0.0.0:10000` (55K+ req/sec via V8 async I/O)
- **Python AI Core**: Private Service / Background Worker (off public internet, internal mesh only)

### Step 3: Memento MCP & Context Optimization

- Fragment memory into atomic 1-3 sentence units
- Categorize: decisions, errors, preferences, procedures
- Multiplex through Redis connection pool
- Keep LLM context window pristine

### Step 4: Sacred Geometry Resonance Activation

| Vector | Function |
|---|---|
| **157** (Serial) | Chronological logging, chain-of-thought, Seed ID |
| **248** (Parallel) | Multi-agent collaborative queries, worker-thread distribution |
| **369** (Evolutionary) | Master validation, Ethics Lock, aesthetic harmony check |
