# Architectural Evolution and Strategic Hardening of the Heady™ Ecosystem

> **Status**: Strategic Infrastructure Report  
> **Date**: March 2, 2026

## 1. Infrastructure Audit and Roadmap (Issue 41)

### 1.1 Critical Vulnerabilities

- **Security Leaks**: `.env.hybrid` with DB credentials in public Git history; `server.pid` and `audit_logs.jsonl` publicly tracked
- **Architectural Sprawl**: 90+ root files, 4 redundant HCAutoBuild scripts, God classes (`heady-manager.js` 90KB, `site-generator.js` 91KB)
- **Language Fragmentation**: No Python/Node.js boundary; conflicting `package-lock.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`

### 1.2 Five-Phase Hardening Roadmap

| Phase | Objective | Key Actions |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Critical Security | Purge history with `git filter-repo`; update `.gitignore`; enable secret scanning |
| 2 | Architecture | Modularize God classes; consolidate build scripts; separate language codebases |
| 3 | DevOps Hardening | Integrate SAST (CodeQL/Semgrep); `npm audit` in CI; branch protection on `main` |
| 4 | Documentation | Unify versioning in `heady-registry.json`; merge 7+ READMEs into `/docs/` |
| 5 | Performance | Redis connection pooling; structured logging (Pino/Winston) |

## 2. 3D Vector Storage and Real-Time Ingestion

### 2.1 The 3D Relevance Framework

Standard vector search fails when context changes over time. Heady resolves this by modulating semantic similarity **S** with a decay constant **λ** over elapsed time **Δt**:

```
R = S · e^(−λΔt)
```

This distinguishes current projects from historical ones sharing semantic keywords.

### 2.2 Optimal Ingestion Protocols

- **Subconscious Formation** strategy: raw data → durable storage (S3 for resources, PostgreSQL for graph edges)
- Asynchronous pipeline extracts atomic facts + generates embeddings
- **HNSW** indexes for sub-100K memory sets
- Scale to distributed providers (Qdrant) for larger volumes

## 3. Persistent Memory: The Triad Architecture

| Layer | Function | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Episodic Memory** | Autobiographical stream | Specific events, raw dialogue logs with high-fidelity timestamps |
| **Semantic Memory** | Stable knowledge | Facts, user preferences, reinforced by Knowledge Graph for entity relationships |
| **Procedural Memory** | How-to system | Learned workflows, prompt rules, core API patterns |

## 4. Buddy Agent Operational Protocols

### 4.1 Write Path — Data Ingestion & Memory Decisions

- **Conscious Fact Extraction**: Filter ephemeral chatter → commit preferences, milestones, system rules
- **Conflict Resolution**: Update Category Summary on contradiction (don't duplicate); flag newest as active, keep old in episodic logs
- **Namespace Segmentation**: Organize data into `user_id/project_id/org_id` namespaces to prevent cross-context contamination

### 4.2 Read Path — Hierarchical Retrieval

1. **Check Summaries First** — category-level summaries (concise, fast)
2. **Vector Fallback** — 3D vector search with temporal decay ranking
3. **Graph Precision** — Knowledge Graph for relationship-based queries

### 4.3 Instantaneous Actions & Integration

- **Push Triggers**: Subscribe to endpoints with callback URLs (eliminate polling latency)
- **Concurrency Management**:
  - `runtimeConfiguration.concurrency.runs` — cap simultaneous actions
  - `runtimeConfiguration.maximumWaitingRuns` — manage overflow queue
- **Multi-modal MIDI**: Treat MIDI ports as standard API streams via `mido`/`python-rtmidi`

### 4.4 Observability & Maintenance — "Nightly Consolidation"

- **Consolidation**: Cluster redundant facts via DBSCAN → merge into semantic knowledge
- **Pruning**: Down-rank/forget low-importance episodic memories not reinforced over time
- **Weave Monitoring**: `@weave.op()` decorator on every memory add/retrieve; attach result summaries as feedback notes
