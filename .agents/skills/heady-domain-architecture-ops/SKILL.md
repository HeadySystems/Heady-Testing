description: Design and operate canonical domain architecture, subdomain routing, OAuth callback normalization, redirect policy, and domain hygiene across the Heady™ ecosystem. Use when the user mentions domain mapping, Cloudflare routing, canonical domains, callback URLs, redirects, or eliminating wrong hostnames from user-facing surfaces.

# Heady™ Domain Architecture Ops

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user needs:

- domain hierarchy planning
- subdomain-to-service routing
- canonical brand/domain mapping
- OAuth callback standardization
- legacy redirect cleanup
- user-facing hostname hygiene

## Core Pattern

The source pattern defines brand-level domains, production and development mappings, API subdomains, standardized OAuth callbacks, redirect rules, CDN domains, email domains, and domain policies in a single canonical configuration ([domain-architecture.yaml](https://github.com/HeadyMe/Heady-pre-production-9f2f0642/blob/main/configs/_domains/domain-architecture.yaml)).

## Instructions

1. Start from canonical brands and surfaces.
   - identify the primary brand domains
   - identify programs or subsidiaries
   - identify commercial, nonprofit, app, admin, API, CDN, and monitoring surfaces

2. Build a routing table with explicit intent.
   For each domain or subdomain capture:
   - domain
   - type
   - purpose
   - backend target
   - auth method if applicable
   - SSL requirement

3. Normalize user-facing hostname policy.
   - Pick one canonical public hostname per surface.
   - Redirect www and legacy aliases.
   - Prevent internal hosts or temporary endpoints from leaking into docs, examples, screenshots, and error messages.

4. Standardize OAuth callbacks.
   - Keep callback paths consistent across environments.
   - Maintain a single registry for production and development callback URLs.
   - Ensure provider configs reference the registry, not ad hoc strings.

5. Separate production, staging, and development clearly.
   - Avoid ambiguous mixed-use domains.
   - Mark which domains are redirect-only.
   - Keep staging and dev on explicit subdomains.

6. Define security policy at the domain layer.
   - HTTPS everywhere
   - security headers
   - mTLS or stronger controls for service-to-service paths where needed

7. Keep email and CDN domains in the same architecture map.
   - This avoids fragmented operational ownership.

8. When auditing an existing setup, look for:
   - duplicate intent across domains
   - public exposure of internal hosts
   - missing redirect rules
   - inconsistent callback URLs
   - mismatch between brand architecture and actual routes

## Output Pattern

Provide:

- Brand map
- Domain routing table
- Callback registry
- Redirect plan
- Security policy
- Hygiene issues and fixes

## Example Prompts

- Rationalize all Heady domains into one canonical architecture
- Audit our callback URLs and redirect rules
- Eliminate internal hostnames from public-facing surfaces
